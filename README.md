# This is my digital portfolio website

## Below are the two links it can be found at

- <https://charlesbird.is-a.dev>
- <https://charlesobird.github.io>

The code within this repository will only work on either:

- Github Pages
- Five Server Visual Studio Code Extension

This is due to the way that these tools use the html files to generate paths.

Each folder with an index.html file within it is a separate path on the website's url e.g. `<url>/projects/index.html` -> `<url>/projects`
