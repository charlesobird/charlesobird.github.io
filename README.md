# This is my digital portfolio website

## Below are the two links it can be found at

Both are valid domains and free

- [Github Pages Domain](charlesobird.github.io)

- [Is A Dev Domain](charlesbird.is-a.dev)

The code within this repository will only work on either:

- Github Pages
- Five Server Visual Studio Code Extension

This is due to the way that these tools use url paths.
